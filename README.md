# Omniverse IndoorKit Extension

![teaser](img/teaser_new.png)

This extension allows to load and record indoor scene tasks for robotics. 

In the field of robotics, it requires a lot of effort to set up even a simple task (e,g. pick up an object) for a robot in the real scene. At present, with the help of Omniverse, not only can we set up tasks for robots in a **photo-realistic** and **physics-reliable** manner, but we build this extension to bring high-quality content with a wide range of **variability** and **randomness**. 

Besides, we design a complete pipline to **load and record the scene**, **control and replay the robot actions**, and **render images**d. We hope this work could encourage academic researches in related field.
